- Server here is a HTTP server  running nginx
- DNS translate domain names to public IP addresses
- DNS returns a A record
- Web server serves web resources over http
- Application server hosts the source code of the application
- Database provides data persistence for the application server
- The Server uses HTTP over TCP/IP network protocol suite to communicate with user computer
- The server hosting Nginx is a single point of failure of this infrastructure as, if it goes down, our application server will not be reachable
- Downtime can be implemented by by pointing our application domain to server hosting a static maintenance page
- This web infrastructure is not scalable as it is running only one instance of the application server
